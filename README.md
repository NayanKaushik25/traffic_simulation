## Domain name: Traffic management in urban areas
## Specifics: 
Overcrowding of roads due to people referring to navigational sites and a majority of them using the same routes.
## Abstract: 
The traffic on our roads has increased manifold over the last couple of decades
especially in urban areas. As a result, much time and energy are wasted on travelling. With the
advancement in technology, various navigation applications have gained come up, the most
popular of these being-Google Maps.
Google Maps provides information about various routes and real-time traffic. However, what
actually happens is that a large number of people look for the same route on Google Maps at the
same point of time and they all choose whichever is given as the fastest route. Because of this,
there is an exponential increase in traffic on the supposedly fastest route.
Our idea is an improvement on Google Maps which counts the number of users using the same
route at the same time, then estimates the increase in traffic if a majority of them takes this same
route. If there is a substantial increase in traffic, it informs the user about the same and advices that
he could take the second-best route instead. This tweak in the system would remove one of the
most basic flaws in todayâ€™s navigation applications.
Hence, lesser time is spent in traffic and the destinations feel closer.
